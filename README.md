# Py.Projects-beginner-level
This contains some Mini projects built using Python just for fun!
## Pig
- this allows user to pick a number of thier choice first and then roll the dice having the numbers from 1 to 6
- when the dice shows a number that is not choosen by the user initially before rolling dice then the value of that number get added to the total points 
-the user looses the game / total score  if the dice shows the number choosen by the user 
-whoever reaches the target first is the winner
## Madlib generator
- this asks user to add their own nouns ,characters , adjective to a story which is already written in a text file and then print the story with user's characters and words 
## Timed Math-prob checker 
- this check the math problem solved by user and and ask questions again if it's wrong and if all the answers are correct then it would show the time the user took to solve all the problems
